# Automated-Detection-of-tuberculosis-from-chest-X-ray-images

The aim of this project is to incorporate a convolutional neural network to detect abnormalities in the chest X-Ray image. The project achieved an 87.5% accuracy on the test dataset comprising of 160 images using DenseNet121 pretrained model. Apart from DenseNet121, this project has also used other models like a convolutional autoencoder, pretrained MobileNetV2.
